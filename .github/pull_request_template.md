# Things to note
- Merging is from `your feature branch` -> `develop` -> `staging` -> `main` -> `demo`
- Please maintain this pipeline at all times. Do *NOT* be tempted to merge to either `staging` or `main` directly using your feature branch
- *Delete* your feature branch after merging to `develop`
